# color_gesture  🤚🎨🎵

This repository contains the codes, written by Juan Sebastián Arias-Valero, to respectively 1) create a frequency modulation path and 2) create a corresponding color path. The codes are associated with the article "Some mathematical and computational relations between timbre and color," by Maria Mannone and J. S. Arias-Valero, accepted for the Mathematics and Computation in Music Conference 2022 (see bellow for the open version).

## 📂 Main Files
